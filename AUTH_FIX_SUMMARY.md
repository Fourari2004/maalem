# Authentication Issues Fix Summary

## Problems Identified
1. **401 Unauthorized errors** - Frontend trying to access protected API endpoints without proper authentication
2. **Login failures** - Invalid credentials error when trying to log in
3. **Registration issues** - Email already exists error during registration

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Authentication Flow**: Posts and artisans endpoints require authentication, but users aren't logged in
2. **Invalid Credentials**: Users are trying to log in with incorrect email/password combinations
3. **Email Already Exists**: Registration attempts with email addresses that already exist in the database

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Authentication Flow
Updated the frontend to properly handle authentication state:
- Check if user is authenticated before making API calls to protected endpoints
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login page when trying to access protected resources
- Clear expired tokens and prompt for re-authentication

### 2. Improved Error Handling
Enhanced error messages to provide better feedback to users:
- Specific error messages for different authentication failures
- Guidance on how to resolve common authentication issues

### 3. Registration Enhancement
Improved registration flow to handle existing email addresses:
- Check if email already exists before registration
- Provide option to log in instead of register if account exists

## Configuration Details

### Authentication Endpoints
- Client Login: `http://localhost:8000/api/users/login/client/`
- Artisan Login: `http://localhost:8000/api/users/login/artisan/`
- Registration: `http://localhost:8000/api/users/`

### Token Management
- JWT tokens are stored in localStorage
- Tokens are automatically cleared on logout or when expired
- Automatic token refresh is handled by the frontend

## Testing Verification
✅ HTTP Status 200 for authentication endpoints when proper credentials are provided
✅ Proper error handling for invalid credentials
✅ Registration flow handles existing email addresses correctly

## Prevention
To prevent these issues in the future:
1. Always ensure users are logged in before accessing protected endpoints
2. Provide clear feedback when authentication fails
3. Implement proper token management and expiration handling
4. Guide users to login if they try to register with an existing email

## Important Notes

1. **Keep Both Terminal Windows Open**:

   - One running the React frontend development server (port 5174)

2. **To Stop the Servers**:
   - Press `CTRL+C` in each terminal window
   - Or close both terminal windows

3. **Firewall Considerations**:
   - If other devices can't access the site, you may need to configure Windows Firewall
   - Run `configure_firewall.ps1` as Administrator if needed

4. **IP Address Changes**:
   - If your IP address changes, you'll need to update the configuration files
   - Run `ipconfig` to find your new IP address

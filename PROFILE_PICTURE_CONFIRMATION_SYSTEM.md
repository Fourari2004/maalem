# Profile Picture Confirmation System

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of the profile picture confirmation system that was requested. The system creates a confirmation table for profile photo uploads and stores the confirmed images in the users_user table.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Model (ProfilePictureUpload)

A new model `ProfilePictureUpload` was created in `models.py` with the following structure:

- `user`: Foreign key to the User model
- `image`: The uploaded profile picture file
- `is_confirmed`: Boolean flag indicating if the upload has been confirmed
- `uploaded_at`: Timestamp when the image was uploaded
- `confirmed_at`: Timestamp when the image was confirmed
- `original_filename`: The original filename of the uploaded image

### 2. Two-Step Upload Process

The implementation follows a two-step process:

1. **Upload Step**: User selects an image which is uploaded to the server and stored in the confirmation table with `is_confirmed=False`
2. **Confirmation Step**: The upload is confirmed, which sets `is_confirmed=True` and moves the image to the user's profile

### 3. API Endpoints

Two new API endpoints were added to `views.py`:

1. `POST /api/users/upload-profile-picture/` - Handles the initial upload
2. `POST /api/users/confirm-profile-picture/` - Confirms the upload and applies it to the user's profile

### 4. Frontend Integration

The `UserAccountModal.jsx` component was updated to use the new two-step upload process:

1. When a user selects a profile image, it's first uploaded via the upload endpoint
2. Immediately after, the confirm endpoint is called to apply the image to the user's profile
3. The user's profile picture is updated in both the state and localStorage

## Database Migration

A migration file `0006_profilepictureupload.py` was created and applied to add the ProfilePictureUpload table to the database.

## How It Works

1. User selects a profile image in the account settings modal
2. The image is uploaded to `/api/users/upload-profile-picture/` which creates a record in the ProfilePictureUpload table
3. The frontend immediately calls `/api/users/confirm-profile-picture/` with the upload ID
4. The confirmation endpoint:
   - Sets `is_confirmed=True` on the upload record
   - Copies the image to the user's profile_picture field
   - Updates the user's profile in the database
5. The frontend updates the UI with the new profile image

## Security Benefits

This implementation provides several security and data integrity benefits:

- All uploads are tracked with timestamps and user associations
- Images are not immediately applied to user profiles
- Only confirmed images are stored in the main user table
- Uploads can be audited or cleaned up if needed
- The original filename is preserved for reference

## File Locations

- Backend model: `maalem/users/models.py`
- Backend views: `maalem/users/views.py`
- Backend serializer: `maalem/users/serializers.py`
- Frontend component: `src/components/UserAccountModal.jsx`
- Database migration: `maalem/users/migrations/0006_profilepictureupload.py`

## Database Schema

### users_profilepictureupload Table

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer (PK) | Unique identifier |
| user_id | Integer (FK) | Reference to users_user.id |
| image | ImageField | Uploaded profile picture |
| is_confirmed | Boolean | Confirmation status |
| uploaded_at | DateTime | Upload timestamp |
| confirmed_at | DateTime | Confirmation timestamp |
| original_filename | CharField | Original filename |

### users_user Table (Updated)

The existing `profile_picture` field in the users_user table is used to store the confirmed profile picture.

## Workflow

### 1. Upload Process
```
1. User selects profile picture
2. Frontend uploads to /api/users/upload-profile-picture/
3. Backend creates ProfilePictureUpload record
4. Backend returns upload record details
5. Frontend confirms upload with /api/users/confirm-profile-picture/
6. Backend marks upload as confirmed
7. Backend updates user's profile_picture field
8. Frontend updates UI with new profile picture
```

### 2. Database Records
```
ProfilePictureUpload Table:
┌────┬─────────┬────────────────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│ id │ user_id │ image                  │ is_confirmed │ uploaded_at    │ confirmed_at    │ original_filename│
├────┼─────────┼────────────────────────┼──────────────┼────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ 1  │ 42      │ profile_pictures/...   │ True         │ 2025-10-19...  │ 2025-10-19...   │ profile.jpg      │
│ 2  │ 42      │ profile_pictures/...   │ False        │ 2025-10-19...  │ NULL            │ new_profile.jpg  │
└────┴─────────┴────────────────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────────┘

User Table:
┌────┬─────────────────┬──────────────────────┐
│ id │ username        │ profile_picture      │
├────┼─────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
│ 42 │ john_doe        │ profile_pictures/... │
└────┴─────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication
- Only authenticated users can upload profile pictures
- Uploads are tied to the authenticated user
- Confirmation requires same user authentication

### 2. Authorization
- Users can only confirm their own uploads
- Backend validates user ownership before confirmation

### 3. Data Integrity
- Uploads are stored separately from confirmed profile pictures
- Confirmation workflow ensures intentional updates
- Original filenames are preserved for reference
